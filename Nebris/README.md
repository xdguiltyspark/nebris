# Celestyx

A translucent theme based on <a href="https://github.com/Astromations/Hazy">Hazy</a>. This is still very much a work in progress, so I will definitely be adding updates later!

Download the repo and put `user.css`, `theme.js` and `color.ini` into a new folder named `celestyx`, and place this folder into your `Themes` folder in `.spicetify`.
Then run these commands to apply:
    
```powershell
spicetify config current_theme Celestyx
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1 inject_theme_js 1
spicetify apply
```
